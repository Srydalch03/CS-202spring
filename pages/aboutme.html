      I was raised in the agriculture world there was not a day where I was not either going to the
      potato warehouse where my father worked or going to work with my own lambs durning the fair season.
      when I was not activly raising a livestock animal I was working on judging animals. The ability to judge
      livestock helps when you are needing to pick out the animal that you would like to show for the year, or 
      the animals that you would like to add to the herd in order to bring in better genetics.
      That is what got me started on the judging path but it can be difficult to follow.

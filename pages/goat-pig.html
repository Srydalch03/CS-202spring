  <h1>Goat and Pig Standards</h1>
  <h2>Pigs</h2>

    <p>
      I will be the first to admit that Pigs and goats are not my best classes, n/ but that is mainly because I am
      hardwired to look for such aspects that you see in cows and sheep.
      The important thing to rember for pigs is to look for the shape of a coke bottle.
      This shape should not be overly drastic but you should be able to easily Identify where the Ribs, Shoulders,
      and Butt start and end.

    <!-- the list items are from a chatGPT Serch -->
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Muscle:</strong> Thick through the ham and loin. Look for width across the top and fullness in the
        center.</li>
      <li><strong>Finish:</strong>This Refers to the Fat amount on the pig. Should be adequate (not excessive) for market
        readiness</li>
      <li><strong>Structure & Movement:</strong>Correct feet and legs, strong pasterns, smooth stride.</li>
      <li><strong>Volume & Capacity</strong>Deep-sided, wide-chested, and good body length.</li>
      <li><strong>Balance</strong> Even proportions front to back with an alert, clean head.</li>
      <li><strong>Identification traits:</strong>Use traits like ear set (up or floppy), body markings, or tailplacement
        in oral reasons.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Goats</h2>
  
    <p>
      <!-- the list items are from a chatGPT Serch -->
      Goats are another species that I personally have diffulty Judging.
      Goats you would assume are just a smaller version of a sheep, However
      when it comes down to it you have to consider what tastes better. On a
      Goat the Fat is beneficial and tastes good. On the other hand sheep fat leaves a nasty
      after taste in the consumers mouth. For this reason Goats tend to be more on the fattier side.
      Looking at a small list to focus what you need to look for in a goat.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Muscle:</strong> Evaluate width and depth in the loin, leg, and rack. Look for shape anddefinition, especially over the top and down the leg.</li>
      <li><strong>Structure:</strong>Straight top lines, correct angles in shoulders and hocks, and solid feet and pasterns are critical for movement and longevity</li>
      <li><strong>Balance & Style:</strong>A clean-fronted, level-designed goat with a good length of body and symmetry between front and rear</li>
      <li><strong>Identification traits:</strong>Use traits like horn shape, coat color/pattern, and ear style in reasons.</li>
    </ul>

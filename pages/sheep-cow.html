    <p>Above are 4 different photos of a steers. When it comes to judging all types of market
      livestock it is importent to rember the 5 structurs of judging. In order of most importent to least
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Muscle</strong>:This is the overall coverage of the muscle in comparison to fat on the steer</li>
      <li><strong>Volume</strong>:This is how large is the animal, but don't think of it as how much meat am I going to
        get off when it is butchard</li>
      <li><strong>Balance</strong>:Have you ever seen an animal and thought that their legs were to short for their body
        that is Balance</li>
      <li><strong>Structure</strong>: Structure and Balance are interchangeable on anyday, the structure is what allows
        the animal to move, thisis often judged by how they stand or walk.</li>
      <li><strong>Bone</strong>:The animal needs to be able to suport the muscle that is requestted. The Bone needs to
        be proportionet.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      When judging market lambs, evaluators look for animals that offer the most value in terms of meat production,
      structural soundness, and overall balance. Successful lambs should be well-muscled, correctly built, and show
      strong indicators of performance and finish.
    </p>
    <h3>Tips for Judging</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>View lambs from multiple angles to assess structure and muscle shape.</li>
      <li>Pay close attention to how lambs track when walkingâ€”proper alignment matters.</li>
      <li>Use terms like <em>"level-topped," "big-hipped," "trim and expressive through the rack and loin."</em></li>
    </ul>
